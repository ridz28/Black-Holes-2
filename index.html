<p>Black Holes are mysterious onjects in our universe. They are caused when a large star dies whose mass is at least three times bigger than Sun. The gravity of it causes a black hole. 
  Nothing can escape a black hole, not even light because of the pull of gravity. Scientists believed for a while that black holes might exist. Albert Eienstein's theory of relativity relates to thsi study. But it was not till
2019 that scientists managed to capture te first image of a black hole. Recent;y, they have recorded the sound of a Black Hole </p>
